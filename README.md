#Home task - Testing Quadratic Equation

##Description
Task is to write and cover with tests a method that solves a quadratic equation.

##Method specification
For the given quadratic equation coefficients (ax^2 + bx + c = 0) return 
array with zero, one or two real roots of the equation. 
Roots in the array may be in any order. 
Specify behavior of infinite roots case by yourself.

##Tests specification
* Ensure that method works fine in general cases:
    * two existing roots
    * one exiting root
    * no roots
* Ensure method works correctly if some of coefficients equal zero
* Ensure method works correctly in special cases 
(like when all coefficients are zeros)

##Steps
1. Complete the method
2. Complete the tests (Tests may go first - TDD)
3. ???
4. PROFIT!
